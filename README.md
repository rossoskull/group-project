# group-project
The first release is in folder "project_v1".

# Installation
Download the folder. 

Compile av.c.

Create a subfolder in the folder "project_v1" named "folder".

Store other dummy files and folders in the folder "folder" which you want to scan.

The viruses are defined in the file "viruses.dat" in the folder "project_v1".

Each line contains the definition of a single virus ( we have used dummy strings as viruses ).

Run the program, and it will scan all the files and folders in the folder "folder", if any portion of the files will be similar to virus definitions, then it will replace them.
